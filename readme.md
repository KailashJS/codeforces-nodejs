## Sorting Algorithm's time complexities:

# Elementary Sorting Algorithms

1. Bubble Sort --> Big(O) of O(n squared)
   1.1. Pussing larget to the end
2. Selection Sort --> Big(O) of O(n squared)
   2.1. Pussing smallest to the end
   These above are n squared time complexities.
3. Insertion Sort :
   relatively
